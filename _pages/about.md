I am a second year master student in the the <a href=https://eee.sustech.edu.cn>Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering</a> at <a href=https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en>Southern University of Science and Technology</a>.

My work focuses on **designing algorithms to help robots handle environmental disturbances and model uncertainty**. I aim to enpower robotic systems to dynamically adapt environment changes in real-time and learn continuously in real-world scenarios, utilizing methodologies from both the learning and control communities.
