**Email:** liuly2023@mail.sustech.edu.cn

I am a second year master student in the <a href="https://eee.sustech.edu.cn/">Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering</a> at <a href="https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en">Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech)</a>. Now, I am a graduate researcher at <a href="https://rcvlab.eee.sustech.edu.cn/">Robotics and Perception Group (RCVLab)</a>, which is advised by <a href="https://faculty.sustech.edu.cn/?tagid=zhangh33&iscss=1&snapid=1&orderby=date&go=2&lang=en">Prof. Hong Zhang</a> (<em>IEEE Fellow</em>).

<!-- Previously, I earned my Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science and Technology from Zhengzhou University. -->

My research interests focus on **navigation, motion planning and control, learning based control, reinforcement learning, LLM applied in navigation**.
I aim to develop intelligent and agile robots that can be applied in people's daily lives.

<!-- Feel free to contact me if you are interested in my works and want to collaborate with me! -->
<!-- Additionally, I was lucky to be a visiting student at [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/) with credits and a research assistant at [Shenzhen Institute of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics for Society (AIRS)](https://airs.cuhk.edu.cn/en/about). -->

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
