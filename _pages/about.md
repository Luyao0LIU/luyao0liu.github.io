**This website is under development. Some of the information on it is not relevant to me. Please do not believe it!**

I am a second year master student in the <a href="https://eee.sustech.edu.cn/">Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering</a> at <a href="https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en">Southern University of Science and Technology</a>.

My work focuses on **designing algorithms to help robots handle environmental disturbances and model uncertainty**. I aim to enpower robotic systems to dynamically adapt environment changes in real-time and learn continuously in real-world scenarios, utilizing methodologies from both the learning and control communities.

<!-- Feel free to contact me if you are interested in my works and want to collaborate with me! -->
<!-- Additionally, I was lucky to be a visiting student at [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/) with credits and a research assistant at [Shenzhen Institute of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics for Society (AIRS)](https://airs.cuhk.edu.cn/en/about). -->

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
